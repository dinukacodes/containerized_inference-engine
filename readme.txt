Project Overview

 project is a self-hosted AI chatbot using vLLM for inference and Gradio for the frontend, all containerized via Docker. The system allows users to interact with an LLM (OPT-125M) through a web-based chat interface.
How It Works
1. vLLM Server (Model Inference)

    The vLLM server is launched inside a container.
    It exposes an API endpoint (http://localhost:8000/v1) where it listens for text prompts.
    When a request is made, it processes the prompt using the "facebook/opt-125m" model and returns a response.

2. Gradio Frontend (User Interaction)

    frontend.py provides a chat interface using Gradio.
    When a user sends a message, it:
        Sends the message to the vLLM server via OpenAI’s API client (configured for local inference).
        The server processes the input and generates a response.
        The response is displayed in the chat UI.

3. Docker & Automation

    The Dockerfile sets up the environment (installing vLLM, dependencies, and setting up execution).
    start.sh likely automates the startup process by:
        Launching the vLLM server.
        Running the frontend.

This setup allows you to host and run your AI model locally without relying on OpenAI’s external servers.
Summary of Workflow

    Run the container → Sets up vLLM & Gradio.
    User inputs a message in the web interface.
    Gradio frontend sends the request to the local vLLM server.
    vLLM processes the request using "facebook/opt-125m" and returns a response.
    Response is displayed in the chat UI.

This makes your chatbot fully self-hosted, flexible, and extendable for local AI experiments. Let me know if you need further details!
